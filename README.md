# CS250---Software-Development-Lifecycle
## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs can be interpreted by conducting meetings and interviews with users before, during, and after sprints. Additional user needs can be discovered by presenting users with completed work after each sprint. Creating user stories allows user needs to be condensed into discernible requirements that given clear directions for how each feature should be implemented and tested. 

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I’ll make sure to keep regular communication with the scrum master, product owner, and tester throughout development. I’ll bring up any issues that come up during the daily scrum. Also, I’ll write detailed documentation about how the features I develop work including any API so testers and future developers will be able to build upon my code easily.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development should be someone who is a team player and has a positive attitude. They should bring up any issues and concerns they encounter as soon as possible and do their best to work in a way that ensures collaborative development.
